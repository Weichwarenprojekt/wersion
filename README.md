# Quickstart

Wersion offers you an automatic workflow for improving your deployment process. It increases your projects version (
including adding a git tag) and generates a release log from your git history.
To determine how the version must be increased wersion uses the commit type from conventional commits. E.g. a fix commit
results in increasing the patch version. The default behaviour can be adjusted with a custom
config ([Configuration](#configuration)).

**Installation**

```
npm i @weichwarenprojekt/wersion --save-dev
```

**Initialization**

The initialization command creates the .wersionrc.ts configration file. The created config depends on the selected preset (npm or flutter).
Further the command will create a git tag on the last commit with the current version of your project to enable versioning.

```
npx wersion --init
```

**Execution**

Basic usage to create a new version:
```
npx wersion
```

Creating a new version includes creating the tag, increasing the version in the configured version file and creating the changelog.

```
npx wersion --releaseAs=[patch|minor|major]
```

See ([Options](#options)) for further information

# Automatic Versioning

Wersion will increase the version once the script is called depending on your git history since the last version tag.
It uses the conventional commit style to determine which part of the version has to be increased. A fix commit ("fix(
scope): Message) will increase the patch version of your project. Similarly, a feat commit will increase your minor
version. Your major version will only be automatically increased if a commit contains a breaking change. This is
signalized by the string "breaking change" in a commits body.
The whole behaviour can be adjusted with different commit types for different version increases and a custom breaking
change text.
Alternatively your always free to increase the version customized by running `wersion --releaseAs=[patch|minor|major]`.

# Changelog generation

The generated text will be added to your changelog file (path and name customizable). Wersion uses your git history and
groups commits in feature and bugfix blocks. Those blocks than are added to the changelog file with the new version as
the header.
For an example checkout the CHANGELOG.md of wersion itself.

# Options

``` 
wersion --releaseAs=[patch|minor|major]
```

The "releaseAs" option allows you to manually increase the version of your project.

``` 
wersion --dry-run
```

"dry-run" prevents wersion from generation any commits or file-changes. Useful for testing the command and see which
versions will be increased.

```
wersion --incrementBuildNumber
```

This mode allows you to increment the build number for local commits. E.g. you can use it in combination with husky
hooks to automatically increment your build number each time you create a new commit.

# Configuration

Configure your project with a .wersionrc.ts file on top level. \
Default configuration:

```ts
import { WersionConfigModel } from "@weichwarenprojekt/wersion";

export const configuration: Partial<WersionConfigModel> = {
  versionFile: {
    path: "./package.json",
    matcher: '"version": ?"([0-9.]+)"',
  },
  commitTypes: {
    major: [],
    minor: ["feat"],
    patch: ["fix"],
  },
  breakingChangeTrigger: "breaking change",
  changelogFilePath: "./CHANGELOG.md",
};
```
